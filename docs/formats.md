# Formats

This repository describes and implements three formats.

 - [UTF-8](utf-8.md)
   - Anything which is valid UTF-8.

 - [Text](text.md)
   - Supports the semantics of any practical Unicode text content.
   - The phrases "text" or "plain text" are used in various ways in many
     contexts, but here "text" refers to a specific format.

 - [Restricted Text](restricted-text.md)
   - Like Text, but with restrictions.
   - Reduced support for historical scripts, multiple-script text,
     formatting, and symbols in exchange for reduced visual ambiguity
     and simplified processing.
   - TODO: This isn't implemented yet.
